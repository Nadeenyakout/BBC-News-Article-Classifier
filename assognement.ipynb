    "- Bias in Training Data:  \n",
    "  The dataset contains only BBC news articles, which may reflect BBC's editorial bias and lack of diverse perspectives from other news sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Risk of Misclassification:  \n",
    "  Incorrect predictions (e.g., labeling a political article as business) can lead to misinformation if used in real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Impact on Users:  \n",
    "  Misclassifications in sensitive categories such as politics or business could mislead readers and harm credibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mitigation Strategies:  \n",
    "  - Use more diverse and balanced datasets from multiple sources.  \n",
    "  - Provide model confidence scores and disclaimers in the app.  \n",
    "  - Regularly retrain and validate the model to ensure fairness and accuracy.  \n",
    "  - Implement explainability tools (e.g., SHAP, LIME) to show why predictions were made."
